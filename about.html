            <p>So, From where should I start,let me just start from the very start dawg.
                the one fucking thing don't regret being friends with these 11th pricks is this one. I came to the came like casual talking. And like everyone been talking about you that
                there's a new girl in the school and shes good I want her etc etc. I was like dawg keep me out of this I'm done shipping ya'll too much I ain't doing no shit, you enter
                class and I go like dawg count me in but the condiiton is ya'll have to ship me now XD. I come up gather up some courage somehow, I don't know if you noticed but I was shaking, 
                and this don't happen often. I came up like asked for the pen you did give me I did not write a word I thought lemme just take this home but then thought nah man giving the Pen
                might start the convo I come up and you didn't even looked at me lmfao, just took the pen and at that moment I thought dawg you cooked. I come home search for your ID and absolutely
                fail at it cause you got that randomass "1" in your username but anyways I did find one nishtha basically a faceless ID and that one followed my friends from Podar so I found all the
                data about her but turned out you're from DPS lmfao. Then idk how tf time just passed like it was may already. Vacations came I had 3 thoughts on my mind. Getting myself fit,
                Getting good grades, Getting Nishtha. Then I just went bald and never came infront of you just really felt embarassed when prisha used to laugh at me lmfao but somehow ya'll got my 
                ID and I'm glad about that lol. Anyways all this aside every since we've been talking I just smile like an idiot most of the times and I am so greatful that we met. Things have been 
                so nice since this past month and everything is going perfect for the first time ever. I've been smashing my grades and got the most beautiful and best girl behaviourally I could
                possibly get, nvm infact you're out of my league idk what made you choose me but haha now you're cooked you ain't going no where. See dude my main thing will always be
                to keep you entertained(even though im a boring mf) but I'll always try my best. I just want to be the one you can come up to and say anything and everything.
                I've seen a lot of dreams with ya lmfao and we'll get it done don't worry about it. I'll be going to some another country in few years and things will get hard but I just
                ask for your understanding in that thing. We'll build a unbreakable trust. I'll be coming once a while though so you don't worry about that. We get take this to next level, being
                absolutely realistic here trust me. I'll never disturb you in your studies neither in anything you wanna do we can just do these shit together dawg. I'm actually really exicted to
                see what we can achieve together. Alright enough of this future bullshit.
